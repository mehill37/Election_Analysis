# Election_Analysis
Using Python

## Overview of Project
Finding Election Results using Python

### Purpose
Understanding the basics of writing code in Python to calculate the results of an election

## Analysis of Election Data
There is a lot of data since it isn't broken down and it's listed by each voter's ID. Too much to go through so we must use Python to search through the data. We can get the results we need very easily by writing some basic python code. We were able to calculate the exact amount of votes and percentage per candidate and county in the race.  

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
If you change something as simple as a space or indent you can change the code and get incorrect results. I had to go back twice to make sure I didn't miss-type something because it still will run but it would give slightly different results. Other than human error there are not any other issues with running this code. It would be extremely useful in other elections to run the calculations.

## Results and Conclusion
### Candidates and thier Results:
Charles Casper Stockham with 23.0% of the votes or 85,213 ballots.
Diana DeGette with 73.8% of the votes or 272,892 ballots.
Raymon Anthony Doane with 3.1% of the votes or 11,606 ballots.
### County Results:
The counties were Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe. Denver had the highest amount of voters with 82.8%. Jefferson had only 10.5% of the voters and Arapahoe with only 6.7% of the voters.

### Conclusion
Out of the three candidates (Charles Casper Stockham, Diana Degette, and Raymon Anthony Doane) Diana DeGette came out as the winner of the election with 73.8% of the votes. Charles Casper Stockham only received 23% of voters and Rayom Anthony Doanes was in last with only 3.1% of voters. The majority of voters live in Denver County.

## Limitations found
I did not see any limitations of using Python to get the results we wanted. 
You could take it a step further and breakdown the ballot ID per counties to calculate what candidate was the favorite in each. 

## Other possible ways to convey the data
Python is the smoothest way to breakdown this kind of data. You can use Excel and filter results to get a similar result, but it is a lot of data and is more manageable in Python.
### Ways to modify the script
You can make the written functions more detailed. We kept it very simple. We also could have input the results per county instead of total to get an idea of the candidates impression on the voters in each county.
