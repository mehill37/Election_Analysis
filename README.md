# Election_Analysis
Using Python

## Overview of Project
Finding Election Results using Python

### Purpose
Understanding the basics of writing code in Python to calculate the results of an election

## Analysis of Election Data
There is a lot of data since it isn't broken down and it's listed by each voter's ID. Too much to go through so we must use Python to search through the data. We can get the results we need very easily by writing some basic python code. We were able to calculate the exact amount of votes and percentage per candidate in the race.  

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
If you change something as simple as a space or indent you can change the code and get incorrect results. I had to go back twice to make sure I didn't miss-type something because it still will run but it would give slightly different results. Other than human error there are not any other issues with the running this code. It would be extremely useful in other elections to run the calculations.

## Results and Conclusion
Out of the three candidates (Charles Casper Stockham, Diana Degette, and Raymon Anthony Doane) Diana DeGette came out as the winner of the election with 73.8% of the votes. Charles Casper Stockham only received 23% of voters and Rayom Anthony Doanes was in last with only 3.1% of voters. 

### Limitations found
I didn't see any limitations of using Python to get the results we wanted. 
You could take it a step further and breakdown the ballot ID per counties to calculate which candidates won each county.

### Other possible ways to convey the data
Python is the smoothest way to breakdown this kind of data. You can use Excel and filter results to get a similar result, but it is a lot of data and is more manageable in Python.
